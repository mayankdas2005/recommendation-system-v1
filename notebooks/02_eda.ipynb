      "{'rating': 3.0, 'title': 'Smells like gasoline! Going back!', 'text': 'First & most offensive: they reek of gasoline so if you are sensitive/allergic to petroleum products like I am you will want to pass on these.  Second: the phone adapter is useless as-is. Mine was not drilled far enough to be able to tighten it into place for my iPhone 12 max. It just slipped & slid all over. Stupid me putting the adapter together first without picking up the binoculars to smell them bc I wasted 15 minutes trying to figure out how to put the adapter together bc it does not come with instructions!  I had to come back here to the website which was a total pain. Third: the tripod is also useless. I would not trust the iOS to hold my $1600 phone nor even a Mattel Barbie for that matter. It’s just inefficient for the job imo.  Third: in order to try to give an honest review I did don gloves & eyewear to check the binoculars out.  They seemed average except for mine seemed to be missing about 10% of the film costing in the lower edge of one of the lenses which would have ruined every video & photograph unplanned to take so for me these are a very huge hard pass.  I expect the accessories that come with the main product to be as good or better than the product I’m buying. Otherwise I would just buy the product as a stand alone.  Sadly, I found a decent pair of binoculars last year with a much better quality phone adapter & tripod, but they had a defect too.  Guess I’m going to have to pay more.

I get ear pain from most, but the smallest buds fit great.  They also have a charger and all of it fits in the carry case. I just wish they came in more colors preferably something bright!

      "{'rating': 5.0, 'title': 'Great laptop backpack!', 'text': \"I was searching for a sturdy backpack for school that would allow me to carry my laptop as well as schoolbooks. After reading many of the reviews of this bag, I placed my order and crossed my fingers. I shouldn't have worried; it's a great bag! Solidly built and traveler-friendly with a ton of compartments for every little thing one might need to stow away. While this backpack is slightly larger than your average backpack, it is comfortable to wear trekking cross campus. Also, another aspect of this bag that I love is that it stands upright. I know that sounds kinda crazy, but I find it annoying when your backpack flops over next to your desk and stuff kind of just falls out, or if you need to grab something quickly out of the bag you have to awkwardly curl your body around the side of your chair and then on the way up, smash your head against the desk. So yeah, lazy girl (points to self) loves the convenience of a bag that stands upright for easy grabbage. I plan to travel with this backpack when I fly home this Christmas instead of bringing a bulky tote bag on the plane.\", 'images': [], 'asin': 'B001OC5JKY', 'parent_asin': 'B001OC5JKY', 'user_id': 'AGGZ357AO26RQZVRLGU4D4N52DZQ', 'timestamp': 1290278495000, 'helpful_vote': 18, 'verified_purchase': True}\n",
